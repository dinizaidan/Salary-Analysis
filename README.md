# Annual Salary Analysis: Industry vs. Experience
This project is the final assessment for the Statistical Method for Data Analytics class, part of the Master of Data Science program at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

This analysis was a collaborative effort between me and my friend, Balqis AG. We successfully presented these findings to our class and lecturer, demonstrating the application of non-parametric statistical methods to real-world salary data.

## Repository Contents
**Salary Analysis.R** : Contains the full R code for data preprocessing (keyword aggregation), log transformation, and non-parametric testing (Kruskal-Wallis & Scheirer-Ray-Hare).

**DATA.xlsx** : The dataset provided by the lecturer.

Sheet 1: Original raw data.

Sheet 2: Selected features with salaries converted to USD (processed in Excel).

## Project Objective
The goal of this study was to determine if salary differences across service industries are statistically significant and how professional experience interacts with these industry categories. We utilized the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test to evaluate interaction effects, accounting for the heavy right-skew common in income data.
